# Concurrency, Theory & Practice -- Summer 2024

- Lecturer: [Prof. Dr. Peter Thiemann](/team/thiemann.md)
- Assistant: [Dr. Bas van den Heuvel](https://basvdheuvel.github.io/)

## Course planning

We plan to discuss the following topics (subject to change):

* Go: language overview
* Go: concurrency
* Dynamic data race prediction
* Dynamic deadlock prediction
* Futures
* Model checking: a short introduction
* Low-level concurrent data structures
* The pi-calculus
* Session types

We have one lecture and one tutorial each week:

- Lecture: Wednesday, 4:15 pm - 5:45 pm, SR 00 031 (G.-Köhler-Allee 051)
- Tutorials: Friday, 12:15 pm - 1:45 pm, R 04 007 Videokonferenz (G.-Köhler-Allee 106)

Note that some tutorials will be held online, ***so keep an eye on the [schedule](#schedule)***.

## Examination and Studienleistung

To pass the course, you need a passing grade on the written exam.
Additionally, you need to pass the Studienleisting, which entails actively participating in the Ilias quizzes.

## Announcements

*2024-07-19*:
1. Unfortunately, the recording software failed on me, so the recording of today's tutorial has only audio. My apologies.
2. Early next week, there will be additional study material available here.

*2024-07-03*:

After today's lecture, the Ilias quiz on the pi-calculus
will be available.
Other than usual, you only have until next Friday (July 5)
at noon to finish the quiz.
This way, we can discuss the exercises during the tutorial.

*2024-06-28*:
1. Please check today's tutorial for clarifications on notation.
2. Next Ilias quiz will be released after next Wednesday's lecture.

*2024-06-20*:
1. A new quiz is available on Ilias, on transition systems
and LTL.
2. The deadline of this quiz is Friday June 28 at noon
(12:00 CEST).
3. There is no tutorial this Friday (June 21).
4. Next week's tutorial (Friday June 28) will be online.

## Schedule

**If the schedule says "Tutorial", there is a tutorial.**
Only if the schedule says "No tutorial" will there be no tutorial.
