## Content

This course conveys fundamental concepts of functional programming using the
programming language [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell).

### Goal

Learning objectives from the module compendium: "Development of a
non-procedural view on algorithms and data structures, confident handling of
higher-order functions and data, knowledge and ability to apply fundamental
functional programming techniques, knowledge of advanced programming concepts,
ability to develop medium-size functional programs independently."

### Topic List

- Definition of functions, pattern matching, higher-order functions
- Types and type classes
- Algebraic data types
- Functional data structures
- Applicative parsers
- Monads and monad transformers
- Arrows
- Verification of functional programs
- Monadic I/O and stream I/O

### Preliminaries

Interest in learning and applying new
programming concepts and languages.

### Literature

The book [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/book.html) by Graham Hutton covers about 30%
of the lecture. This book is available in the TF-library.

## Communication

We provide a [discord-like chat](https://chat.laurel.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/invite/vEuyqw)
to allow for asynchronous questions about the lecture, exercises, and
functional programming in general. You can log in there with your Ilias
credentials.

Announcements will be posted on this page under the rubric [News](#news).
Urgent announcements will also be sent via email through HisInOne.
